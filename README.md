Welcome to my Machine Learning Model Comparison project! In this project, I set out to explore the performance of various machine learning models on a specific task. The goal was to identify the model that achieved the highest predictive accuracy and area under the curve (AUC).

Objective
The primary objective of this project was to compare the performance of different machine learning models on a given dataset. By experimenting with a range of models, we aimed to determine which one yielded the best overall results in terms of AUC and accuracy.

Models Explored
I delved into several individual models, each with its own unique characteristics:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Bagging
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Results
After rigorous experimentation and analysis, the results spoke for themselves:

Random Forest emerged as the star performer with an impressive AUC of 0.83 and an Accuracy of 0.84. These numbers underscore the model's ability to effectively predict and classify data.
Project Insights
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning models. The process allowed me to deepen my understanding of model selection and evaluation metrics
